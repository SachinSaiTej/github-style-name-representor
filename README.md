# GitHub Name in Contributions Format

This project generates your name in the format of GitHub contributions throughout the year. It uses custom algorithms to create a visual representation of your name by filling in the contribution grid with different levels of activity.

## Features

- Displays your name in the style of GitHub contribution heatmaps.

## How It Works

1. The program maps each letter of your name to a specific grid of contribution cells.
2. Each cell in the grid corresponds to a day of the year and a specific contribution level.
3. The generated grid simulates GitHub activity, creating a heatmap that spells out your name.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/github-name-contributions.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd github-name-contributions
   ```

## Usage

1. Run a live server in the project directory. If you don't have one, you can use the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code or a similar tool.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser via the live server.
3. Enter your name in the input field (if applicable).
4. The program will generate a contribution heatmap displaying your name.
